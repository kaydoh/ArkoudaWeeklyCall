# ArkoudaWeeklyCall

### Info and slides used for the weekly Arkouda call

30min call every Wednesday at 10am ET to discuss Arkouda algorithms, code, and methods.

**we will post topic or meeting cancelation notices in the slack channel**


This repo will probably hold PDFs mostly.

We will be taking requests for subjects to talk about as long as it has to do with Arkouda... ;-)

Submit an issue with your requested subject.
