# ArkoudaWeeklyCall
### Info and slides used for the weekly Arkouda zoom call

30min call every Tuesday at 1pm ET to discuss Arkouda algorithms, code, and methods.

This repo will probably hold PDFs mostly.

We will be taking requests for subjects to talk about as long as it has to do with Arkouda... ;-)

Submit an issue with your requested subject.
